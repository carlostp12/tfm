\begin{enumerate}
		\item Account for Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD): Galaxies' peculiar velocities distort their measured positions along the line of sight (RSD). It is possible to incorporate modeling or a scaling factor, like recent studies (sOptics) \cite{Hai-Xia-Ma:2025}. 
		\item Next generation of survey data upcoming from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST. These surveys offer far greater volume, depth, and precision, allowing for the detection of smaller, fainter structures at higher redshifts.
		\item  Implement advanced Machine Learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
