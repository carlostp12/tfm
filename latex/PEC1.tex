	\subsection{Justification of intererest and relevance}
	 In this work we want to answer partially the question of how is shape arround our position, in this case the Milky Way, this can be done now a days thanks to the unsupervised techniques and the data collected from Surveys such as SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and 2D
	 When we apply machine methos to data provided from the Surveys we expect to find some structure
	\subsection{Personal motivation}
	As a Master Degree in Data Science, AstroIT developer and 
	
	 Since the beginning of time, the man has always looked at the nigth sky and felt the feeling of the inmense and profound dark of the Universe. This lead us o the question of our postion within the Universe.
	 Now a days, sets of data are been collected directly from satellites and published, making them accessible to everyone via internet. Modern Machine Learning techniques can be apply to this data sets to yield interestring insights. That is main aim of this paper.
