	\subsection{Justification of intererest and relevance}
	 In this work we want to partially answer question of how density-based algorithms can be applying to figure out how visible matter(1) is shaped arround our position in the Universe.
	 
	 Now a days we all are furtunated to have public Surveys such as SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and 2DFGRS ( Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshidft survey) which producing data accesible for everyone. These data contain among others thigs, hundreds of rows representing galaxies with their redshifts. By applying Universe-models like Labmda-CDM to these data it is possible to estimate the distance of such objects to Earth. 
	 
	 How dense the matter is? how galaxies are distributed along the Universe? Is it possible to answer these questions using density-based algorithms?
	 	 
	 Density-based unsupervised methods should be able to find the same structure: galaxy clusters integrated on superclusters.
	 
	 \subsection{Personal motivation}
	 
	 As a Master Degree in Data Science I am interested in knowing if density-based algorithms can guess how clusters and superclusters of galaxies are arranged within the Universe.
	
	\subsection{Objectives}
	  \begin{itemize}
	   \item An alternative way to guess how matter is distributed in a big scale arround the Via Lactea.
	   \item Clusters of galaxies detection througth density-based algorithms.
	   \item Apply densiy algorithm to locate clusters and superclusters of galaxies.
	  \end{itemize}
