	\subsection{Justification}
	 In this work we want to partially answer question of how density-based algorithms can be applied to determine the shape of visible matter(1) arround our position in the Universe.
	 
	 Today we are all fortunate to have public surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift (2DFGRS) that produce data accessible to everyone through internet. These data contain among others thigs, thousands of rows representing galaxies with their redshifts. By applying Universe-models like Labmda-CDM to these data it is possible to estimate the distance of such objects to Earth. 
	 
	 How dense the matter is? how galaxies are distributed along the Universe? Is it possible to answer these questions using density-based algorithms?
	 	 
	 Density-based unsupervised methods should be able to find the same structure: galaxy clusters integrated on superclusters.
