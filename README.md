# How the project is Divided
The project utilizes both Python and R due to their role as the primary programming languages throughout the Master's program. The overall structure of the project is systematically divided as follows:
* PYTHON: This segment encompasses all scripts related to data preprocessing and data acquisition. Furthermore, the Python environment includes several Jupyter notebooks dedicated to the calculation and analysis of the correlation function estimators
* R: This component is dedicated to the evaluation of all density-based algorithms under consideration. It includes the execution of these algorithms and the subsequent derivation of the final conclusions across the following datasets:

1. Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS).

2. Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7).

3. Re-Real Space SDSS-DR7.
